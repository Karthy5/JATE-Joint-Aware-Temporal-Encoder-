# JATE (Joint-Aware-Temporal-Encoder)
 **JATE is a custom Action Recognition model (`jate_model.pth`)**, developed entirely by the author. This involved:
*   Single-handedly creating a **custom dataset** comprising 150 videos relevant to retail scenarios.
*   Designing and training a **unique neural network architecture** (using PyTorch) specifically for recognizing actions like "reaching," "standing," and "walking".
*   *Currently authoring a research paper on this model and dataset for potential publication in a conference or journal.*
